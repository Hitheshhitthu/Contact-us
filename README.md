# Contact-us
Description:
This project is a simple **Contact Form** built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes fields for Name, Email, and Message, with real-time **client-side validation**. JavaScript ensures that all fields are filled and the email follows a valid format using regex. If validation fails, appropriate error messages are shown below each input. Upon successful validation, a success message is displayed, simulating a form submission.
